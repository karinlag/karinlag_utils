##Purpose: detect,trim and quantify MID tags in both ends of 454 sequences.

```
Options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -f FILE, --fastafile=FILE
                        fasta filename
  -q FILE, --qualfile=FILE
                        qual file, optional
  -m FILE, --midfile=FILE
                        midfile name
  -v INT, --varsize=INT
                        variable region size
  -o STRING, --outnametag=STRING
                        output filename tag

```

This script takes as input a fasta file, and optionally a qual file, together with a file listing MID tag names and sequences. The script goes through each sequence and tries to find any of the listed tags in either end of the sequence (in the 3Â´ end, the reverse complement is searched for). The tag should be found within the set variable size (-v) in either end, otherwise it is not considered as found. If a tag is found (in either end) within the varsize limit, any trailing characters are removed, and the sequenced is output with the tag name(s) added to the fasta/qual description line. Note: a sequence will be included in the output only if a forward MID is found. Additionally, the sequence should in the end either have the same mid reverse complemented, or no mid should be found.
